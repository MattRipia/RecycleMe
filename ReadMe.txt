---- Version 1.0 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applications purpose and main goal:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application was designed to help Aucklanders appropriately recycle items depending on their zone/location and also tells the users which items can be recycled by scaning the barcode of an item to return a recyling number. Currently only recycling numbers 1 and 2 can be recycled in Auckland and depending on the item scanned tells the user whether or not their item is recylible or not. Other features of the application includes detailing the makeup of these different types of plastics, determining the next recycling day based off where the user lives as well as being able to set notifications to notify a user to take their bins out the day before pickup.


Current Features:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Google/Facebook Authentication using Firebase as a manager/centralized service.
- Barcode scanner api which returns the barcode of an item and references the database for additional info.
- Tracking of users, item data and scan history though a microsoft sql server hosted on Azure cloud platform.
- Online database.
- Scan history of a user.
- A leaderboard with the top 10 users of our application and their points.
- The ability to determine a users current location + the ability to input a new address.
- The ability to determine whether or not an item is recyclible or not.


To come:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Using the users current location to determine their next pickup day.
- Using the next pickup day to set notifications reminding users the day before pickup.
